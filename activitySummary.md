# Activity Summary

Given that our group opted to work on an extension, our activity did not have much to do with the core Adobe/Brackets repositor.

Below you'll find the issues we examined, and the commits we made to our extension project.

## Issue's Examined:

1) [Image Preview for Large Images Freezes Application](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/14117)

* We verified this issue on Mac, but given that it was a performance issue it seemed too complicated for us to approach.
* Jacob Helfgot examined on this issue.
